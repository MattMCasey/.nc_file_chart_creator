# .nc_file_chart_creator
A quick python script to create seaborn time series charts from a folder of .nc files. 

Initially created to help David Lindo Atichati visualize data following a hackathon at the American Museum of Natural History.

# What is this?

This script takes a folder of .nc files and turns them into a timeseries plot.

# How can I use it?

This script was built with the specific intent of charting two sets of data over a variable amount of time. If you have two sets of data, just alter the code where I've pointed out and it will work.

If you would like to chart one line, comment out one of the production lines. If you would like to chart additional lines, follow the format and add additional lists, etc.
